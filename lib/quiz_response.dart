It consists of three-nucleotide sequences called codons, each of which codes for a specific amino acid. There are 20 common amino acids, and each amino acid is coded for by at least one codon.\n\nThe genetic code is characterized by the following properties:\n\n* It is **specific**, meaning that each codon codes for a specific amino acid.\n* It is **universal**, meaning that the same codon codes for the same amino acid in all organisms.\n* It is **non-overlapping**, meaning that each nucleotide is used only once in a codon.\n* It is **degenerate**, meaning that most amino acids are coded for by more than one codon.\n\n**Non-polarity** is not a characteristic of the genetic code. Non-polarity refers to the chemical nature of certain amino acids, not to the genetic code itself. Polar amino acids have charged side chains, while non-polar amino acids have uncharged side chains. The polarity of an amino acid affects its solubility and its interactions with other molecules.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nThe genetic code was first deciphered by Marshall Nirenberg and Har Gobind Khorana in the 1960s. They used a technique called cell-free protein synthesis to determine which codons coded for which amino acids. The genetic code has since been found to be universal in all living organisms, with a few minor exceptions.","type":null,"is_mandatory":false,"show_in_feed":false,"pyq_label":null,"topic_id":150,"reading_material_id":3159,"fixed_at":null,"fix_summary":null,"created_by":null,"updated_by":null,"quiz_level":null,"question_from":"Q-bank","language":null,"photo_url":null,"photo_solution_url":null,"is_saved":false,"tag":"","options":[{"id":13535,"description":"Non-Polar","question_id":3381,"is_correct":true,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.542+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.542+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null},{"id":13536,"description":"Non-Overlapping","question_id":3381,"is_correct":false,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.544+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.544+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null},{"id":13537,"description":"Commaless","question_id":3381,"is_correct":false,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.546+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.546+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null},{"id":13538,"description":"Universal","question_id":3381,"is_correct":false,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.549+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.549+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null}],"reading_material":{"id":3159,"keywords":"[\"Genetic Code\", \"DNA\", \"RNA\", \"Transcription\", \"Translation\"]","content":null,"created_at":"2024-11-30T18:43:10.465+05:30","updated_at":"2024-11-30T18:43:10.465+05:30","content_sections":["<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Genetic Code Characteristics</title></head><body><h1>The Genetic Code</h1><h2>Introduction to the Genetic Code</h2><p>This chapter explains how our genes (made of DNA) create proteins.

This process is carried out by the ribosomes in the cytoplasm of cells.\n\n**The steps of translation are as follows:**\n\n1. **Initiation:** The ribosome binds to the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule at the start codon (AUG). A specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the amino acid methionine (Met) binds to the start codon.\n2. **Elongation:** As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, different tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to their complementary codons on the mRNA. The amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain.\n3. **Termination:** Translation is terminated when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered on the mRNA. The polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome and folding begins to form the functional protein.\n\nTherefore, translation is the process that converts the genetic information in nucleotides into the amino acid sequence of a protein.","type":null,"is_mandatory":false,"show_in_feed":false,"pyq_label":null,"topic_id":150,"reading_material_id":3156,"fixed_at":null,"fix_summary":null,"created_by":null,"updated_by":null,"quiz_level":null,"question_from":"Q-bank","language":null,"photo_url":null,"photo_solution_url":null,"is_saved":false,"tag":"","options":[{"id":13523,"description":"Replication","question_id":3378,"is_correct":false,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.493+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.493+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null},{"id":13524,"description":"Transcription","question_id":3378,"is_correct":false,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.495+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.495+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null},{"id":13525,"description":"Translation","question_id":3378,"is_correct":true,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.498+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.498+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null},{"id":13526,"description":"Reverse transcription","question_id":3378,"is_correct":false,"created_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.500+05:30","updated_at":"2024-07-13T23:16:32.500+05:30","unanswered":false,"photo_url":null}],"reading_material":{"id":3156,"keywords":"[\"Translation\", \"Genetic Code\", \"Protein Synthesis\", \"Polymer of amino acids\", \"Polymer of nucleotides\"]","content":null,"created_at":"2024-11-30T18:43:09.921+05:30","updated_at":"2024-11-30T18:43:09.921+05:30","content_sections":["<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Protein Synthesis</title></head><body><h1>From DNA to Protein: Transcription and Translation</h1><section><h2>Introduction to Protein Synthesis</h2><p>Our DNA holds the instructions for building all the proteins our bodies need.
